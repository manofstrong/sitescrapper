# Site Scrapper
A PHP library to scrape websites based on their sitemaps and extract relevant content from the webpages the content is then uploaded a database for later use.

The [Sitemaps.org](http://www.sitemaps.org/) protocol is the leading standard and is supported by Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask and many others and has now become an accepted means of displaying webpages in a website and their relevance. This has meant that most of the modern websites have implemented sitemaps which makes it easier for a web scrapper to avoid unnecessary measures to find the links and go straight to the source. Please note that the library can recursively parse through sitemaps so only one sitemap per website is needed. 

This library also eliminates the need for exploring site specific html tags in search of the relevant content by stripping down the page content to the most important parts of the page by removing boilerplate and extracting the rest as full text. The library then obtains the keywords of the extracted text and the word count of the text. These are essential for later data analysis and keywords. Finally, the library uploads the content into MySQL database whose schema has been provided in the database folder of this project. 

Basically, this is a blind bulk scrapping tool, just provide it with a list of sitemaps, run it. It will run for as long as it takes to scrape through the pages of the websites provided and upload them to the database for you. 

**This library is designed to be run from the Command Line rather than web browser. Please consider it a CLI tool and use it as such.**

## Installation
The library is available for install via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). Just add this to your `composer.json` file:

## Getting Started

### Basic display example
Returns the content of a specified number of pages from a single sitemap. Does not store into database.

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use manofstrong\SiteScrapper;
$scrapeThisSite = new SiteScrapper();

$singleSitemapUrl = 'https://www.php.com/sitemap.xml';   // can be .xml or .xml.gz or robots.txt file
$numberOfPages = 2;										 // must be a digit without single or double quotation marks: '2' or "2" will fail.
 
$scrapeThisSite -> showContentSiteMap($singleSitemapUrl, $numberOfPages);

```
This command displays the content of each page as an array with the four elements the url, the title, the keywords, the content, and the word count as shown in the image below:

### A single sitemap
Method to extract the webpages from a single sitemap. This will go through the sites and update the database provided. It will return the url and completion status. 
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use manofstrong\SiteScrapper;
$scrapeThisSite = new SiteScrapper();

$singleSitemapUrl = 'https://www.php.net/sitemap.xml';
 
// MySQL table structure in the database folder of this repository
$scrapeThisSite -> databaseCredentials('database','host','username','password'); 

$scrapeThisSite -> singleSiteMap($singleSitemapUrl);
```
### Array of sitemaps
Method to extract the webpages from sitemaps provided via array. This will go through the sites in the array, and update the database provided. It will return the url and completion status. This is advisable if you have less than 10 different sites that you want to scrape.
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use manofstrong\SiteScrapper;
$scrapeThisSite = new SiteScrapper();

$sitemapArray = ['https://site1.com/sitemap.xml','https://site2.com/sitemap.xml','https://site3.com/sitemap.xml'];

// MySQL table structure in the database folder of this repository
$scrapeThisSite -> databaseCredentials('database','host','username','password'); 

$scrapeThisSite -> siteMapsArray($sitemapArray);
```
### File of Sitemaps
Method to extract the webpages from sitemaps provided via array. This will go through the all sites in the file, and update the database provided. It will return the url and completion status. This is advisable if you have more than 10 different sites that you want to scrape.

The file must must a text file and the each sitemap must be in its own line without any other text. The urls must also be in compliance with the `[RFC 2396]`(https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt).
```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use manofstrong\SiteScrapper;
$scrapeThisSite = new SiteScrapper();

$sitemapFile  = __DIR__ . '/yourtextfile.txt';
 
// MySQL table structure in the database folder of this repository
$scrapeThisSite -> databaseCredentials('database','host','username','password'); 

$scrapeThisSite -> siteMapFile($sitemapFile);
```

**Sample file structure**

    https://site1.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site2.com/sitemap.xml
    http://site3.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site4.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site5.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site6.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site7.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site8.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site9.com/sitemap.xml
    https://site10.com/sitemap.xml
    https://www.site11.com/sitemap.xml
    https://www.site12.com/sitemap.xml
    http://www.site13.com/sitemap.xml

## Limitations:
This is not a precise data collection tools especially for those who want to obtain specific sections of a webpage to the exclusion of others. This library simply collects the most important section of the webpage such as large blocks of text. Therefore, this library best works for someone with the goal of massive text data collection and extraction for big data or other analytical research.
